# mimium

mimium(*MInimal-Musical-medIUM*) is a domain specific programming language for describing/generating sound and music.

mimium is assumed to be used in a composition, rather than real-time performance.

It is much more similar to Musical Markup Languages though it have many programming-like features like loop and control sequence.

A final purpose is to edit a source code written in this language with gui as a programmable/parametric music creation software/DAW.

More specific info about language is currently in [design](design/design-proposal.md) section.
